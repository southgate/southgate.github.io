title: "Tarken"

I met Tarken in 5th grade at Antwerp International School.  I was taken with and emulated his peculiar habit of always wearing his jacket indoors regardless of temperature.  I also held in high regard his decision to limit himself to only artificial flavorings.

For a couple of summers running I would spend large portions of the summer staying at the Winn's house. It was a bit chaotic and free-range and I loved being there.  Our partner in crime, Robert Kerns, lived nearby and we could easily get to the skate park, the bmx track, and a far superior sweet shop to my own local.  They were, without question, the *good old days*.

I spent a US summer / NZ winter traveling in New Zealand when I was 19, reuniting with Tarken and the Winn clan.  Among other adventures, the two of us drove down to Lake Waikaremoana and tramped around for 4 days, mostly in the rain.  It was beautiful and I loved it but I distinctly remember whining about the weather and how tired I was. Tarken was nothing but enthusiasm and good vibes.

A few years ago, my then girlfriend and I were on vacation on a small island near Bali.  We'd found a nice beach bar from which to watch the sunset.  We spotted a picnic table and, unwisely, both sat down on the same side.  As one would expect, the table tipped backwards and we narrowly escaped  embarrassment at the very least.

As I'm dusting myself off, I notice some dude standing at a distance just staring at us.  "What the hell is this guy staring at?" I remember thinking.  Then he says, incredulously, "Alex?".  I squint, "Tarken?".

I hadn't seen him in 17 years and here he was with Toni and their beautiful daughter, Lumi, who was very intent on ensuring no one attempted to clothe her. We spent a couple of warm evenings together catching up and just hanging out.  I'm so very grateful that I had the chance to meet his new family and see my old friend one last time. What a gift.

I will miss him dearly.
