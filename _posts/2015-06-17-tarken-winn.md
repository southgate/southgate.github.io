title: "Tarken Winn"
---

I met Tarken in 5th grade at Antwerp International School.  I was taken with and emulated his peculiar habit of always wearing his jacket indoors regardless of temperature.  I also held in high regard his decision to limit himself to only artificial flavorings.

For a couple of summers running I would spend large portions of the summer staying at the Winn's house.  Tarken's house was chaotic and free-range and I loved it. It was closer to our partner in crime, Robert Kerns, the skate park, the bmx track, and a far superior sweet shop to my own local.

I spent a US summer / NZ winter traveling in New Zealand when I was 19, reuniting with the Tarken and the Winn clan.  Among other adventures, the two of us drove down to Lake Waikeramoana and tramped around for 4 days, mostly in the rain.  I remember whining about the weather and how tired I was but nothing but good energy coming from Tarken.  One of the character qualities I value the most in friends is being game for anything and Tarken was most definitely that.

A few years ago, my girlfriend and I were on vacation on a small island near Bali.  We'd found a nice beach bar to watch the sunset from.  We spotted a picnic table and both sat down on the same side.  As one would expect, the table tipped backwards and we narrowly escaped an embarrasing wipe out.  As I'm dusting myself off, this guy is standing at distance just staring at me.  "What the hell is this guy staring at?" I remember thinking.  Then he says, incredulously, "Alex?".  I squint, "Tarken?".

I hadn't seen him in 17 years and here he was with Toni and their beautiful daughter, Lumi, who was very intent on ensuring no one attempted to clothe her. We spent a couple of warm evenings together catching up and just hanging out.  I'm so very grateful that I had this chance to see my old friend one last time.

I will miss him dearly.
