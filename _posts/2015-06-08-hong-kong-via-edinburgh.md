title: "Around The World: New Years in Edinburgh en route to Hong Kong (BA F, BA J, CX F)"

### Planning

Sometime in May 2014 I started thinking about my next award trip as I had a fair number of miles that needed to be burned before another devaluation made our lives slightly less amazing.

I had 60k Dividend Miles already, on top of which I took advantage of the share miles promo available at the time wherein you could get up to 100% bonus when sharing your miles with someone.  I found a co-conspirator on flyertalk and edged my balance up to 125k.

My extended family in the UK were planning to rent a house near Edinburgh for New Years so I started planning around that. US Airways had just recently ended the 90k mile award for business class from North America to North Asia with a stopover in Europe.  That award now prices at 110k but you can still book first class for 120k miles: a great deal for a round the world trip in first. I set about finding availability to somewhere in North Asia via the UK.

Generally speaking availability around Christmas is a little tricky but it seems to open up a bit around New Years.  I've been to Hong Kong before so that was a little lower on the list than, say, Shanghai but either one seemed like a fair target as the "destination".  The general plan was to fly British Airways to the UK for New Years then onto China for a couple of days via Cathay Pacific, continuing home to San Francisco.

Using [ba.com](http://ba.com) I was able to find availability directly from SFO to LHR.  I used Avios to book the LHR-EDI R/T but I'll get to that later. The Europe to Asia segment was pretty straightforward and I was able to book BA ClubEurope LHR-MXP and Cathay Pacific First MXP-HKG.

I wanted to be back in SFO by my birthday, January 9, and I was easily able to find a seat in First on the Cathay Pacific non-stop HKG-SFO.

I was motivated to book this particular award as for a period of time US Airways was [not adding fuel charges for awards on British Airways](http://thepointsguy.com/2014/04/using-us-airways-miles-to-avoid-british-airways-fuel-surcharges/).  They had recently joined oneworld as part of their merger with American but had not yet updated their pricing engine to charge for the expensive fuel surcharge.

The trick here was to book a relatively simple itinerary that could be booked by their pricing engine.  If the award went to their rates desk, who'd been informed to price awards *with* BA's YQ fuel surcharge, the taxes would double.

When I called in to US Airways to price the award I was told that it would cost 115k miles (120k - 5k miles because I have a US Airways Visa - though I think that's generally for awards that are 100% US metal) and $412.79 in taxes + the $50 award processing fee.  The taxes and fees if the YQ fuel surcharges were included would be around $800 so the trick worked and I booked the ticket.

Since I wanted to book the simplest possible trip I didn't route to Shanghai and didn't try to include the legs to EDI, instead opting to have HKG be the destination and booking the LHR-EDI return using 9,000 Avios.

Total cost: 115k Dividend Miles + 9k Avios + $462.79 in taxes and fees.

I'm terrible at taking pictures along the way for trip reports, so forgive the crappy ones I do have.

### British Airways Terraces Lounge

As reviewed elsewhere the First Class Lounge is just a small lounge within the Terraces lounge.  The food and drink were the same, as far as I could tell.  I ended up moving to the larger lounge as I needed to make a phone call and there are a series of cubicles that allow for some privacy.  About 40 minutes before departure First Class passengers were invited to board and I did so through a dedicated entrance to the gangway.

*The ride to LHR*

### British Airways First Class SFO-LHR
*BA 284 12/30/14 1610 - 1030 + 1 Day*

I was greeted by the purser who escorted me to 1K, declaring it "the best seat in the house, sir".

Like any respectable miles dork I was the first aboard. I had assigned myself 1K a couple of days earlier. one of the couples had 1A and 2A.  I offered my seat so they could sit next to each other and they happily agreed. As has been written before row 2 are the most private seats and I was happy to have moved.

![img_3138](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/52830/6323036/e3dd0210-bad6-11e4-8eba-f23b86e6a966.JPG)
*2K is a comfortable distance away*

With the doors closed there were a total of 7 passengers in first: two couples and two other single travelers besides myself.  The nose of a 747 feels far quieter and more secluded than any other spot on a plane and 2A felt like the sweetspot.

Around 530pm we were served dinner which I ate while I took care of some work.

*A rather boring salad*

I'd been going to bed very early and getting up very early the previous couple of days to get closer to the UK schedule so I went to sleep not long after dinner was cleared.

I slept for a solid 5 hours, woke up, and ordered a Full English breakfast.  Breakfast was cleared and we were on the ground at 1026 GMT.

*Heathrow under typically cloudy skies*

### British Airways ~~Arrivals Lounge~~ Concorde Room, LHR Terminal 5

Club World was held until the First Class cabin deplaned.  Since I'm also a UK citizen I moved through immigration quickly and checked in for my onward flight to EDI.

My understanding is that passengers departing on International First Class have access to The Concorde Room.  I, on the other hand, was booked on a separate domestic ticket in Economy to EDI.

I thought I'd give it a shot anyway.  I got the top of the escalator where all of the Heathrow lounges are and played a little dumb asking which lounge I should go to.  I showed her my boarding pass for SFO-LHR to which she responded, "First Class? You're welcome to enjoy the Concorde Room."  The gentleman at the entrance to the Concorde Room didn't flinch at my boarding pass.   I'm not sure if that's normal or just a one off but it's worth a shot.

I found the Concorde Room in JFK to be much nicer, food included, and the service much more attentive.  I ordered a cappuccino and answered some emails in the meeting room than grabbed some food in the dining room which, though my favorite cuisine (free), was just okay.

*Lunch in the Concorde Room*

I couldn't get a Cabana so I took a shower in one of the Elemis Spa showers.  It was functional and *mostly* clean though the shower made a disturbing gurgling sound as water entered the drain.

### British Airways Economy LHR to EDI
*BA 1448 12/31/15 1405 - 1526*

This was an uneventful economy class flight.  I will say that compared to US domestic flights, BA domestic is significantly more pleasant: newer planes, nicer staff, better drink selection, and better snacks.

It was great to see my extended family and celebrate the New Year. We stayed in Dunfermline, just north of Edinburgh.

![Dunfermline](https://scontent-a-sjc.cdninstagram.com/hphotos-xpa1/t51.2885-15/928664_746150882134393_1884340141_n.jpg)

### British Airways Economy EDI to LHR
*BA 1447 1/3/15 1625 - 1747*

Another uneventful domestic economy class flight.  My flight to HKG left the the following morning so I booked a room at The Stanwell which is a perfectly fine hotel.  The only issue is that getting there cost £24 for a 10 minute cab ride.  

I got up at 4am to get a run in before my flights and this time opted for an Uber to the airport instead of a taxi which end up running me £9 instead.


### British Airways LHR to MXP
*BA 572 1/4/2015 740 - 1049*

I arrived at Terminal 5 at 545am, checked in and made it through security and to the lounge  within 10 minutes. Since I was flying ClubEurope I headed straight for the British Airways Galleries Lounge.

A nice cold breakfast spread was to be had along with the usual espresso machines, coffee, newspapers, and a pre-dawn view of the apron.

The 2 1/2 hour flight to MXP went without incident.  I had a full english breakfast and coffee.

### Cathay Pacific MXP to Hong Kong
*CX 234 1/5/2015 1231 - 0557 + 1 day*

After checking my email and quaffing a couple glasses of water in the Sala Viale lounge I made my way down to the gate where boarding had already begun.  There was no wait in the FastTrack line so I walked through and turned left.

![img_3196](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/52830/6498389/62ec56c0-c2a0-11e4-98f5-603db8ba2811.jpg)
*View from the lounge with my ride to HKG in the distance*

I was escorted to my seat, 1K.  I always enjoy seeing who else is riding First Class.  Who's potentially on revenue, who's on an award, who's the frothing miles nerd.  Today's flight had a full first class:

- A surprisingly giddy elderly gent.
- A young girl flying alone, maybe around 14.
- A late 30s guy bearing a slight resemblance to Guy Fieri.
- A family of four with a toddler and an infant sitting behind me in 2K and 2J.  

The family of four were Italian.  She was definitely over 6 feet tall. This being Milan, I'd venture that she is or was a model.  He was impeccably, if casually, dressed.  Well played, wealthy and fabulous Italian family, well played.  

They had just two seats, but it seemed to be fine given that the kids were tiny and the seats huge.  I was initially worried that I'd have two screaming kids behind me but they were extremely well behaved and I didn't hear them at all until the last 30 minutes of the flight.

Dinner was served immediately after departure.  As airplane food goes it was tasty.

*I went with the Chinese dinner*

![img_3215](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/52830/6498407/84ab354c-c2a0-11e4-8a32-83c075ba1c53.jpg)
*And the fruit and cream for desert*

After dinner, I slept for a solid 5 hours, woke up and ate breakfast.  Eating and sleeping: it's what I do best on planes.

### Cathay Arrivals Lounge

Arriving early, I thought I'd get a shower before heading to the hotel since the room wasn't available until 1pm.  The Arrivals Lounge, which is nothing fancy being a repurposed contract lounge, is a bit tricky to find.  Once you exit immigration and baggage claim, it's in the far left corridor on the way to the Kowloon Airport Express train.  The shower was very decent and they had an okay spread of food but I didn't touch it.


### Hong Kong

![img_3232](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/52830/8029552/7a1c291a-0d73-11e5-8dce-6159bea5ab4d.jpg)
*Hong Kong Diner Kong*

I spent 2 days in Hong Kong with a friend who happened to be in town mostly just walking about, eating, and drinking.  Hong Kong is great for a couple day stopover but I'm not terribly compelled to return for a longer trip.

![img_3261](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/52830/8029554/7a1fdec0-0d73-11e5-8a46-e100635bebd6.jpg)
*Signage in Kowloon*


### The Wing, The Bridge

I'd heard about checking bags at the Kowloon Airport Express station so I did just that.  The check-in experience is obviously not as slick as First Class at the airport but I was bag-free for the next 20 hours which I was very happy with.

There's no expedited security for premium passengers at HKIA; a surprising bit of egalitarianism in such a hot bed of capitalism.  No matter, I'm a man of the people. Also it took all of 5 minutes.

Once through, I walked all the way left to The Wing. It was late in the day and I was ready to take a shower and relax so I'd arrived at the airport around 3 1/2 hours before departure.  

A cabana was available, so I spent an hour in there showering, shaving, and lazing about.  I can't imagine a better way to pass an hour in an airport before a long flight.  My friend who met me at SFO commented that I looked remarkably *refreshed* after a 12 hour flight.

![img_3270](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/52830/8029553/7a1e6f4a-0d73-11e5-8972-2e8ead768da8.jpg)
*The oft-photographed Cabana*

I ordered some dinner in the restaurant which was fairly crappy.  Since I had some time to spare I took a walk over to The Bridge - the business class lounge at the opposite end of the terminal.  

I found it to be more comfortable and provided a view of the apron, so I plonked down, had a snack, and did some last minute email.

Around departure time I walked *all* the way back to the gate A3, passing through a final security check at the gate. The line for economy was *HUGE*, there was a small line for business, and as you'd expect, no line for first class, so I just sauntered on in. And *that*, ladies and gentlemen, is the most decadent part of this whole business.

### Cathay Pacific First Class HKG-SFO
*CX 872 Seat 1A 0117 - 0952 - 1 Day*

First class was full on this leg.  My compatriots were a middle aged Chinese man behind me.  A Chinese mom, dad, and daughter and a young guy based in SFO I'd wager was also traveling on miles.

As I settled into 1A, the very friendly and professional crew went about their work diligently.  As soon as we were airborne, I was asked if I would like dinner.  It being approximately 130am and me being shattered, I declined and asked to have my bed made.  I slept for a 5 solid hours and woke up to try to get back onto PST.  

I ordered 2 coffees and finished watching Under the Skin then ordered the Chinese dinner option and watched Hunger Games 2.  The short day turned to night once again and we were descending into SFO shortly thereafter.

I was first off the plane and with Global Entry was waiting for my bag about 5 minutes after leaving the plane.  Coincidentally a good friend was visiting and arrived at the same time as me so we met up, hopped into a car and were home 30 minutes after touchdown.

### Fin

This was one of my favorite award redemptions since I started this game a few years back. Travel over the holidays can be stressful but going solo and flying premium cabins makes the whole thing just so damn easy.  Factor in some time with family that I really enjoy being with and hanging out with a friend in foreign territory and you've got yourself a great little trip.

A+++ would fly again.
